Feel free to analyse the code, but it needs a rewrite before it can be used in prod.

## ??? What's this about there not being data for a type?
SMWStuff.net has categories for types of data. However, only two of those actually contain files - the rest are placeholders (presumably the dev was planning on adding support for them). Because of this, I cannot reverse-engineer the internal API.
